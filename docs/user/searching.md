# Searching For Files

Baloo provides a convenient tool called `baloosearch` which can be used to
perform searches. Additionally Baloo is also integrated in popular
applications such as KRunner and Dolphin.

    /home/user/Music/Coldplay - Ghost Stories
    /home/user/Music/Coldplay - Ghost Stories/01. Always In My Head.mp3
    /home/user/Music/Coldplay - Ghost Stories/06. Another's Arms.mp3
    /home/user/Music/Coldplay - Ghost Stories/03. Ink.mp3


## Advanced Searches

Baloo offers a rich syntax for searching through your files. Certain
attributes of a file can be searched through.

For example 'type' can be used to filter for files based on their general type

`type:Audio` or `type:Document`

Currently the following types are supported -

* Archive
* Audio
* Video
* Image
* Document
* Spreadsheet
* Presentation
* Text

These expressions can be combined using `AND` or `OR` and additional parenthesis.
