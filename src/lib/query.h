/**
 * @class Query query.h <Baloo/Query>
 *
 * The Query class is the central class to query to search for files from the Index.
 *
 * This class has an inbuilt parser which recognizes words along with AND / OR and parenthesis
 * and specific properties. This can be used with the setSearchString method
 *
 * @example -
 * "Fire" -> Looks for all files which contain the word "Fire"
 *
 * @example -
 * "Fire OR water" -> Looks for files which contain either "Fire" or "Water". The capitalization
 * of the words doesn't matter as that will be ignored internally. However, OR and AND have to
 * be in upper case.
 *
 * @example -
 * "artist:Coldplay" -> Look for any files with the artist "Coldplay"
 *
 * @example -
 * "artist:(Coldplay OR Maroon5) power" -> Look for files with the artist Coldplay or Maroon5 and
 * the word "power"
 *
 * @example -
 * "artist:'Noah and the Whale'" -> Look for files with the artist "Noah and the Whale"
 *
 * @example -
 * "type:Audio title:Fix" -> Look for Audio files which contains the title "Fix" in its title.
 *
 * The Query Parser recognizes a large number of properties. These property names can be looked
 * up in KFileMetaData::Property::Property. The type of the file can mentioned with the property
 * 'type' or 'kind'.
